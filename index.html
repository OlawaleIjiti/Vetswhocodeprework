  <h1> Hey Welcome To A Little About Me!</h1> <hr>
  </div>

  <p>My name is Olawale Ijiti, you can address me as "Wale" to make life easier ðŸ˜‰. 
   I'm a easy going person that just enjoy the simple things life has to offer. I moved to America 5 years ago, and i've been on the go since then. I joined the Navy, and became an Operation Specialist, which gave me an opportunity to see the world in a different prespective.#Hooyah!!!
   <br> <br>

    I have developed love for the ocean, the glowing creatures i saw while i was on watch at night, hiking to the top of mountains, swimming with the fishes in Israel and counting the stars in the sky at night. <br> <br>

    After i was discharged i developed love for trading stocks, and i was curious about what made all i was doing possible on the trading platform. That was when i started falling in love with software development, with no computer science background my curiousity lead me to looking for opportunities to learn. My first try wasn't great but i was proud that i tried, it seemed really hard but i was hungry and i am still hungry to learn. <br> <br> 
    So far Mr JavaScript has not been nice to me but i'm looking forward to having JS as one of my favorites<br> <br>

    I added my resume so i can get any critic and advice on it. <br> <br>

    Thank you for reading through!
